<b>Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</b>
</p> <p>  
You and the Company agree to arbitrate all disputes between you and the Company or its affiliates, except disputes relating to the enforcement of the Company or its affiliates’ intellectual property rights. “Dispute” includes any dispute, action or other controversy between you and us concerning the Trendit Services or these terms, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute or regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. You and the Company empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable.
 </p> <p> 
In the event of a dispute, you or the Company must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute and the relief requested. You must send any notice of dispute to Trendit, _4666 Penkwe Way, Eagan, MN 55122_, USA, Attention: Legal/Arbitration Notice. We will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and the Company will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or we may commence arbitration. You may also litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute involves a claim for monetary damages in a sum less than $1000, whether or not you negotiated informally first.
 </p> <p> 
If you and the Company do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. For more information, visit www.adr.org or, in the United States, call 800-778-7879. Arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
 </p> <p> 
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America, and you and the Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located there, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
 </p> <p> 
PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. Neither you nor the Company will seek to have a dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration.
 </p> <p> 
<b>Choice of Forum</b>
 </p> <p> 
You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms or the Trendit Services that is not subject to arbitration shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in the state or federal courts located in the county of Hennepin, Minnesota, United States of America and you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating such action.
</p> <p> 
<b>Choice of Law</b>
 </p> <p> 
These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota and the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.
 </p> <p> 
<b>Severability</b>
 </p> <p> 
If any provision of these terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
 </p> <p> 
<b>Survival</b>
 </p> <p> 
The provisions of these terms which by their nature should survive the termination of these terms shall survive such termination.
 </p> <p> 



<b>Waiver</b>
 </p> <p> 
No waiver of any provision of these terms by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
